# Rubin Microlensing metrics


This repository contains the work done by the microlensing subgroup of the Transients and Variable Stars (TVS) science collaboration of the Rubin observatory. We aim at writing and evaluating metrics in the Metrics Analysis Framework (MAF) to evaluate the performance of different observing strategies simulated for Rubin.
